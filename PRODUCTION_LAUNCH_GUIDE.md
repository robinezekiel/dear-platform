## Launch Day Procedures

### 1. Final Pre-Launch Verification (T-2 hours)
\`\`\`bash
# Run final test suite
npm run test:all

# Verify production build
npm run build
npm run start

# Check all health endpoints
curl https://dear-platform.com/api/health
\`\`\`

### 2. Database Migration (T-1 hour)
\`\`\`bash
# Backup current database
npm run db:backup

# Run migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Verify data integrity
npm run db:verify
\`\`\`

### 3. Deployment (T-0)
\`\`\`bash
# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Verify deployment
npm run verify:production
\`\`\`

### 4. Post-Launch Monitoring (T+1 hour)

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics
- Page load time: < 2 seconds
- API response time: < 500ms
- Database query time: < 100ms
- AI response time: < 5 seconds
- Uptime: 99.9%

### Scaling Thresholds
- CPU usage > 70%: Scale horizontally
- Memory usage > 80%: Investigate/scale
- Database connections > 80%: Scale database
- Response time > 1s: Investigate performance

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Procedures
- Database: Automated daily backups with 30-day retention
- File storage: Replicated across multiple regions
- Configuration: Version controlled in Git

### Recovery Procedures
1. Identify issue scope and impact
2. Communicate with stakeholders
3. Implement fix or rollback
4. Verify system stability
5. Post-mortem analysis

## Monitoring Dashboards

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- User registrations per hour
